                        <h2>Q1 : Agile vs DevOps</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Following are the differences</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Agile involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process.</li>
                            <li>Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model.</li>
                            <li>This software development method emphasizes on incremental, iterative, and evolutionary development.</li>
                            <li>It breaks the product into small pieces and integrates them for final testing.</li>
			    <li>It can be implemented in many ways, such as Kanban, XP, Scrum, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
			<h2>VS</h2>
			<ul>
                            <li>The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations.</li>
                            <li> This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations.</li>
                            <li>DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers,quality assurance(QA) engineers and system administrators.</li>
                            <li>promotes collaboration between Dev and Ops team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way.</li>
                        </ul>
			<h2>Q2 : CI Definition</h2>
                        <p class="lead">CI stands for continuous integration, a fundamental DevOps best practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run.</p>
			<h2>Q3 : CI and CD Explanation</h2>
                        <p class="lead">For CI Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch.</p>
                        <h2>And</h2>
			<p class="lead">Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.</p>
                        <h2>Q4 : What are the Cloud Computing Benefits?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Following are the benefits</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cost Savings</li>
			    <li>Security</li>
			    <li>Flexibility</li>
			    <li>Mobility</li>
			    <li>Insight</li>
			    <li>Increased Collaboration</li>
			    <li>Quality Control</li>
			    <li>Disaster Recovery</li>
			    <li>Loss Prevention</li>
			    <li>Automatic Software Updates</li>
			    <li>Competitive Edge</li>
			    <li>Sustainability</li>
                        </ul>
			<h2>Q5 : Define GIT Reset Methods</h2>
                        <p class="lead">There are 3 methods listed below</p>
                        <ul>
			<h2>MIXED</h2>
                            <li>Remove's the commit from local repo, and also remove changes from staging area.</li>
			<h2>SOFT</h2>
                            <li>Remove's the commit from local repo, but keep the les in staging area.</li>
			<h2>HARD</h2>
                            <li>Remove's the commit from local repo, and staging area and even change the local less.</li>
                        </ul>
